# C++ Game

## TODO

* Stop networking and finish the game w/ threads
	* Collision size and pos data for each mob
	* Actually shoot projectiles (SpawnProjectileEvent)
	* Inventory render
	* Simple projectile collision
	* Pathfinding on a separate thread

* Networking: Input prediction + sync inputs and snapshots + toggle

* Basic game UI

* Projectiles

* Life


* std::to_string is not a great solution

* Retry client connection when it fails

* Better jump gravity & proper height

* More maps
