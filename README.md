# C++ Game

## TODO

* Enemies
	* Pathfinding on a separate thread

* Render "arrow count"
* Render health bars + die

* Long & short jumps
	* Jump cooldown + Use forces + "increase gravity mid-air"

* Small input delay for removing shoot direction
* Handle looping of non-fixed rotation projectiles

----

* Basic game UI

* Networking: Input prediction + sync inputs and snapshots + toggle
	* std::to_string is not a great solution
	* Retry client connection when it fails

* More maps

* Other game modes
